# Project Idea

The idea is to develop an e-learning platform that supports both students and educators. The platform will allow students to access courses, participate in online discussions, view grades, and submit assignments. Educators will have the ability to create and manage courses, upload assignments, grade submissions, and provide feedback to students.

Key features of the platform will include:
- **User Authentication and Role Management**: Students and teachers will have different roles with access to different features.
- **Course Management**: Educators can create, update, and delete courses.
- **Assignments**: Students can submit assignments, and educators can grade them.
- **Forum/Discussion Board**: A space for students to interact with each other and ask questions to the instructor.

The platform will be scalable, allowing a large number of students and educators to use it simultaneously while maintaining high performance and usability.
