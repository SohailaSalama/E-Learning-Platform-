# Project Problem Statement

The problem this project aims to address is the lack of an efficient, scalable online learning platform for both students and educators. Current solutions like Moodle and others are often difficult to use, lack flexibility, and don't scale well to larger user bases. Students face challenges in accessing their coursework, submitting assignments, and interacting with instructors, while educators struggle to manage course materials, assignments, and student progress.

This project seeks to build an intuitive, feature-rich, and scalable online learning platform that allows students to access courses, interact with instructors, and submit assignments seamlessly, while providing educators with tools to create courses, grade assignments, and manage the learning experience.
